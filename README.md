# <img src="docs/img/logo_title.svg" width="100"/> Finite-state morphology for German

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/timur-morph/community](https://badges.gitter.im/timur-morph/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/timur-morph/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This package started as a migration of a set of finite-state grammars for the morphological analysis of German words delivered with [`SFST`](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/SFST/), a finite-state transducer (FST) toolkit by [Helmut Schmid](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/), to [`Pynini`](http://www.opengrm.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/Pynini), another FST toolkit. The latter has the advantage that it is implemented as a python library allowing for seamless interaction with tons of other useful python packages. By now, a number of morphological operations have been added and some analysis strategies adjusted in comparison to the original rule set.

## Installation

`timur` is implemented in Python 3. In the following, we assume a working Python 3 (tested versions 3.5 and 3.6) installation as well as a working C++ compiler supporting C++-11.

### OpenFST

The underlying FST toolkit `Pynini` is itself based on [`OpenFST`](http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/WebHome), a C++ library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and searching weighted FSTs. [Get](http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/FstDownload) the latest version of OpenFST, unpack the archive, build and install via
```console
$ configure --enable-grm
$ make
$ [sudo] make install && [sudo ldconfig]
```
### re2

**TODO**

### virtualenv
Using [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) is highly recommended, although not strictly necessary for installing `timur`. It may be installed via:
```console
$ [sudo] pip install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environement in a subdirectory of your choice (e.g. `env`) using
```console
$ virtualenv -p python3 env
```

and activate it.

```console
$ . env/bin/activate
```

### Python requirements
`timur` uses various 3rd party Python packages (including `Pynini`) which may best be installed using `pip`:
```console
(env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Finally, `timur` itself can be installed via `pip`:
```console
(env) $ pip install .
```
